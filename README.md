Assignment 1:Web Development
Submission Date:9th April 2017






This is the first time that I have designed the web page. At, first it was very difficult to design the website. Then slowly I showed the interest and decided to learn from many websites, learned from teachers and slowly I designed my web page. Every day I used to visit many websites and see how the websites could be more attractive. Daily I used to spend 2-3 hours in designing the website. The main website that helped me when designing the web page was www.w3schools.com.Firstly, in first week I didn’t have the concept of designing web pages. Teachers used to teach but I didn’t get idea. But, slowly I started learning from my friends, learned from different websites. In the middle week I had learned little a bit more concept about designing. Got, to learn about CSS through websites. In the   middle week I was too guided by the teachers he guided me very well and was able to create web page. For the more attraction of the web page I concerned with and asked help with the friends and the teachers. I learned to link the pages. Till the middle week I was not yet so confident and perfect enough, at the last week I learned to make forms through w3schools.Now it was the time to submit the assignment and I was fully concerned about submitting the project so I started learning and making forms for my web page and make my contact page more attractive.  This is the form page that I have created. Though creating   this is not tough and hard but it took me a lot of time to create this. So, in the last week I learned many things. In the 1st semester we aren’t taught the java script. After learning the java script we can develop the websites for the company. So, in the coming week I am looking towards it. While creating the web page I learned cloning and pushing in the github.For creating the web page it is the main thing to push the files in github.So, as soon modifying the codes we should push the files in the github. By learning all the html codes, CSS,pushing the files at the github by web page is simple.In the home page I have just put the navigation bar,image and footer part.I haven't describe and written anything in the home page. In bio page i have used navigation bar and written about self that needs to be include. In C.V part I have put the image in the circular way, and describe about education qualification and working expireance.In, the contact page I have put forms which I learned in the last weeks before submitting the assignments. For creating my web page  w3schools.com helped me a lot specially I learned about CSS, linking the pages.As an IT student I feel very happy that I learn to make some simple kind of web pages. In, the first semester I have learned just making web pages without using the java script.After completing the 1st year we can be able to create the special and perfect web page.
