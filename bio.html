      Introduction of life:<br>
  <p>I was born on May 23,1998.I was grown and spend my childhood in kathmandu.
  I learned and experienced many things to live life from my parents.They inspired
  me whole life.While I was 15 years I passed my school and enter the high school and studied computer science and passed my high schools with good marks.
  After the complatation of my high school the life was enjoyable but lot of stress.The enjoyable part was that I got the oppurtinty to visit many places,got to make many new friends,
  and stress was that what should be done with life i was in dilema.I think that was the time where I was most confused. Althogh I was from computer background I didn't want to study IT but there was almost 7 months gap
  then i realised and think how difficult it is I should learn and be good at compueter subject.
  Now I am study hard to be a good network engineer.In between the gap after the complatation of my high school I was in great trouble thinking about my future.
  I thought those past days and I thought if those days would be back haha.Those days were full of happiness a piece of inoscent, the fun with friends. i am missing all those days.
  But life changes for the reason, and should be changes to have a great and independent life ahead.Now all the friends are having and living their life some are studying some are in abroad for further study and to have a good job.</p>


  What means life to me:<br>
                                <p>As talking about life it was only the family and few friends whom I trust.I am pretty much on the  happy side of life, but like all teens, I do have my days off. I have only few friends with whom i can sort out my feelings.
                                They used to solve my problems easily. Those few friends have been a great in my life.Talking about family,they have always been with me in each and every step of mine life.Whateever may be the problem they have always been there with me.
                                They have fullfiled my each and every wants everytime.After, the complatation my bachelor's level I should make them happy and fulfill their wants like they have fullfilled my wants now.
                                My mother has been the greatest motivation of mine life.She taught me how to handle thelife in greater way.She taught me to be brave and so many things.
                                So, in my life I have been attached with few people and I am happy to have those people in my life.I don't have a lot of friends but nowdays there are many people amd new friends with whom i can hang over.
                                Slowly,life compales to do what we want and should be adjusted on any kind of environment.Life is not easy as we think, for the succesfull and great life we must work hard on our goals.</p>
